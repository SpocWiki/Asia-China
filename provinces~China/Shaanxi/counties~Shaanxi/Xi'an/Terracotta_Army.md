> The Terracotta Army is a collection of terracotta sculptures 
> depicting the armies of Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China. 
> 
> It is a form of funerary art buried with the emperor in 210–209 BCE 
> with the purpose of protecting him in his afterlife.
>
> The figures, dating from approximately the late 200s BCE, 
> were discovered in 1974 by local farmers in Lintong County, outside Xi'an, Shaanxi, China. 
> 
> The figures vary in height according to their rank, the tallest being the generals. 
> 
> The figures include warriors, chariots and horses. 
> 
> Estimates from 2007 were that the three pits containing the Terracotta Army 
> hold more than 8,000 soldiers, 130 chariots with 520 horses, 
> and 150 cavalry horses, the majority of which remain in situ 
> in the pits near Qin Shi Huang's mausoleum. 
> 
> Other, non-military terracotta figures have since been found in other pits, 
> including those of officials, acrobats, strongmen, and musicians.
