## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Tibetan Plateau, also known as the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau, Qingzang Plateau, 
> or as the Himalayan Plateau, 
> is a vast elevated plateau located at the intersection of Central, South, and East Asia. 
> 
> Geographically, it is located to the north of Himalayas and the Indian subcontinent, 
> and to the south of Tarim Basin and Mongolian Plateau. 
> 
> Geopolitically, it covers most of the Tibet Autonomous Region, 
> most of Qinghai, the western half of Sichuan, Southern Gansu provinces, 
> southern Xinjiang province in Western China, Bhutan, 
> the Indian regions of Ladakh and Lahaul and Spiti (Himachal Pradesh) 
> as well as Gilgit-Baltistan in Pakistan, northwestern Nepal, 
> eastern Tajikistan and southern Kyrgyzstan. 
> 
> It stretches approximately 1,000 kilometres (620 mi) north to south 
> and 2,500 kilometres (1,600 mi) east to west. 
> 
> It is the world's highest and largest plateau above sea level, 
> with an area of 2,500,000 square kilometres (970,000 sq mi). 
> 
> With an average elevation exceeding 4,500 metres (14,800 ft) 
> and being surrounded by imposing mountain ranges that harbor 
> the world's two highest summits, Mount Everest and K2, 
> the Tibetan Plateau is often referred to as "the Roof of the World".
>
> The Tibetan Plateau contains the headwaters of the drainage basins of 
> most of the streams and rivers in surrounding regions. 
> This includes the three longest rivers in Asia (the Yellow, Yangtze, and Mekong). 
> 
> Its tens of thousands of glaciers and other geographical and ecological features 
> serve as a "water tower" storing water and maintaining flow. 
> 
> It is sometimes termed the Third Pole because its ice fields 
> contain the largest reserve of fresh water outside the polar regions. 
> 
> The impact of climate change on the Tibetan Plateau is of ongoing scientific interest.
