## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Liaoning** is a coastal province in Northeastern China 
> that is the smallest, southernmost, and most populous province in the region. 
> With its capital at Shenyang, it is located on the northern shore of the Yellow Sea, 
> and is the northernmost coastal province of the People's Republic of China.
>
> Historically a gateway between China proper and Manchuria, the modern Liaoning 
> province was established as Fengtian or Fengtien Province (奉天省) in 1907 
> and was renamed Liaoning in 1929. 
> It was also known at that time as Mukden Province for the Manchu name of Shengjing, 
> the former name of Shenyang. 
> 
> Under the Japanese-puppet Manchukuo regime, the province reverted to its 1907 name, 
> but the name Liaoning was restored for a brief time in 1945 and then again in 1954.
>
> Liaoning borders the Yellow Sea (Korea Bay) and Bohai Sea in the south, 
> North Korea's North Pyongan and Chagang provinces in the southeast, 
> Jilin to the northeast, Hebei to the southwest, and Inner Mongolia to the northwest. 
> 
> The Yalu River marks the province's border with North Korea, 
> emptying into the Korea Bay between Dandong in Liaoning and Sinuiju in North Korea. 
> Liaoning is also one of China's leading provinces in research and education. 
> 
> As of 2023, two major cities in Liaoning ranked in the world's top 200 cities 
> (Dalian 37th and Shenyang 124th) by scientific research output, as tracked by Nature Index.
