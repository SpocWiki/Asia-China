> The Liao River (simplified Chinese: 辽河; traditional Chinese: 遼河; pinyin: Liáo Hé) 
> is the principal river in southern Northeast China, 
> and one of the seven main river systems in China. 
> 
> Its name is derived from the Liao region, a historical name for southern Manchuria, 
> from which the Liaoning province, Liaodong Peninsula, and Liao dynasty also derive their names.  
> The river is also popularly known as the "mother river" in Northeast China.  
> 
> Coursing 1,345 kilometres (836 mi) long, the Liao River system drains a catchment basin 
> of over 232,000 square kilometres (90,000 sq mi), 
> but its mean discharge is quite small at only about 500 cubic metres per second, 
> about one-twentieth that of the Pearl River. 
> The Liao River has an exceedingly high sediment load because many parts of it flow through powdery loess.
>
> The Liao River is also an important geographical landmark, 
> as it divides the modern Liaoning province into two broad regions — 
> Liaodong ("east of Liao") and Liaoxi ("west of Liao"). 
> 
> Historically, this demarcation though was not based on the river itself, 
> but on a large wetland that once existed on the right (west) bank of the lower Liao River 
> known as the Liao Mire (辽泽), which stretched east of the Yiwulü Mountain 
> to the Liao River from Xinmin to Panshan.
