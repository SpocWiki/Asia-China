> The **Three Kingdoms** of Cao Wei, Shu Han, and Eastern Wu dominated China 
> from AD 220 to 280 following the end of the Han dynasty. 
> 
> This period was preceded by the Eastern Han dynasty 
> and followed by the Western Jin dynasty. 
> 
> Academically, the periodisation begins with the establishment of Cao Wei in 220 
> and ends with the conquest of Wu by Jin in 280. 
> 
> The period immediately preceding the Three Kingdoms, from 184 to 220, 
> was marked by chaotic infighting among warlords across China as Han authority collapsed. 
> 
> The period from 220 to 263 was marked by a comparatively 
> stable arrangement between Cao Wei, Shu Han, and Eastern Wu. 
> 
> This stability broke down with the conquest of Shu by Wei in 263, 
> followed by the usurpation of Cao Wei by Jin in 266 
> and ultimately the conquest of Wu by Jin in 280.
>
> The Three Kingdoms period including the collapse of the Han 
> was one of the most dangerous in Chinese history due to multiple plagues, 
> widespread famines, and civil war. 
> 
> A nationwide census taken in 280, following the reunification of the Three Kingdoms 
> under the Jin showed a total of 2,459,840 households and 16,163,863 individuals 
> which was only a fraction of the 10,677,960 households, 
> and 56,486,856 individuals reported during the Han era. 
> 
> While the census may not have been particularly accurate 
> due to a multitude of factors of the times, in 280, 
> the Jin did make an attempt to account for all individuals where they could.
>
> Technology advanced significantly during this period. 
> Shu chancellor Zhuge Liang invented the wooden ox, 
> suggested to be an early form of the wheelbarrow, 
> and improved on the repeating crossbow. 
> 
> Wei mechanical engineer Ma Jun is considered by many 
> to be the equal of his predecessor Zhang Heng. 
> 
> He invented a hydraulic-powered, mechanical puppet theatre 
> designed for Emperor Ming of Wei, square-pallet chain pumps 
> for irrigation of gardens in Luoyang, 
> and the ingenious design of the south-pointing chariot, 
> a non-magnetic directional compass operated by differential gears.
>
> The authoritative historical record of the era 
> is Chen Shou's Records of the Three Kingdoms (c. 290 AD), 
> in tandem with the later annotations published in 429 by Pei Songzhi. 
> 
> While comparatively short, 
> the Three Kingdoms period has been romanticised in the culture of the Sinosphere. 
> It has been retold and dramatised in folklore, opera, and novels, 
> as well as film, television, and video games. 
> 
> The most well-known fictional adaptation of the history is Romance of the Three Kingdoms, 
> a historical novel written during the Ming dynasty by Luo Guanzhong.
