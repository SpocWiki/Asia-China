> The Great Leap Forward was an industrialization campaign within China from 1958 to 1962, 
> led by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). 
> 
> CCP Chairman Mao Zedong launched the campaign 
> to transform the country from an agrarian society into an industrialized society 
> through the formation of people's communes.  
> 
> The Great Leap Forward is estimated to have led to 
> between 15 and 55 million deaths in mainland China 
> during the 1959–1961 Great Chinese Famine it caused, 
> making it the largest or second-largest famine in human history.
>
> The Great Leap Forward stemmed from multiple factors, including 
> - the purge of intellectuals, 
> - the surge of less-educated radicals, 
> - the need to find new ways to generate domestic capital, 
> - rising enthusiasm about the potential results mass mobilization might produce, and 
> - reaction against the sociopolitical results of the Soviet Union's development strategy. 
> 
> Mao ambitiously sought an increase in rural grain production and an increase in industrial activity. 
> Mao was dismissive of technical experts and basic economic principles, 
> which meant that industrialization of the countryside would solely be dependent on the peasants. 
> Grain quotas were introduced with the idea of having 
> peasants provide grains for themselves and support urban areas. 
> 
> Output from the industrial activities such as steel was also supposed to be used for urban growth. 
> Local officials were fearful of the Anti-Right Deviation Struggle 
> and they competed to fulfill or over-fulfill quotas which were based on Mao's exaggerated claims, 
> collecting non-existent "surpluses" and leaving farmers to starve to death. 
> Higher officials did not dare to report the economic disaster which was being caused by these policies, 
> and national officials, blaming bad weather for the decline in food output, took little or no action.
>
> The major changes which occurred in the lives of rural Chinese people 
> included the incremental introduction of mandatory agricultural collectivization. 
> Private farming was prohibited, 
> and those people who engaged in it were persecuted and labeled counter-revolutionaries. 
> 
> Restrictions on rural people were enforced with public struggle sessions and social pressure, 
> and forced labor was also exacted on people. 
> Rural industrialization, while officially a priority of the campaign, 
> saw "its development ... aborted by the mistakes of the Great Leap Forward". 
> Economist Dwight Perkins argues that "enormous amounts of investment 
> only produced modest increases in production or none at all. ... 
> In short, the Great Leap [Forward] was a very expensive disaster".
>
> The CCP studied the damage that was done at various conferences from 1960 to 1962, 
> especially at the Seven Thousand Cadres Conference in 1962, 
> during which Mao Zedong ceded day-to-day leadership to pragmatic moderates 
> like Chinese President Liu Shaoqi and Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping. 
> 
> Acknowledging responsibilities for the Great Leap Forward, Mao did not retreat from his policies; 
> instead, he blamed problems on bad implementation and "rightists" who opposed him. 
> He initiated the Socialist Education Movement in 1963 and the Cultural Revolution in 1966 
> in order to remove opposition and re-consolidate his power. 
> 
> In addition, dozens of dams constructed in Zhumadian, Henan, during the Great Leap Forward 
> collapsed in 1975 (under the influence of Typhoon Nina) and resulted in the 1975 Banqiao Dam failure, 
> with estimates of its death toll ranging from tens of thousands to 240,000.
