> The Spring and Autumn period (c. 770 – c. 481 BCE) 
> was a period in Chinese history corresponding roughly to 
> the first half of the Eastern Zhou (c. 771 – 256 BCE), 
> characterized by the gradual erosion of royal power as local lords 
> nominally subject to the Zhou exercised increasing political autonomy. 
> 
> The period's name derives from the Spring and Autumn Annals, 
> a chronicle of the state of Lu between 722 and 481 BCE, 
> which tradition associates with Confucius (551–479 BCE). 
>
> During this period, local polities negotiated their own alliances, 
> waged wars against one another, up to defying the king's court in Luoyi. 
> 
> The gradual Partition of Jin, one of the most powerful states, 
> is generally considered to mark the end of the Spring and Autumn period 
> and the beginning of the Warring States period. 
> 
> The periodization dates to the late Western Han (c. 48 BCE – 9 CE).
