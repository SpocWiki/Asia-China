> The Boxer Rebellion, also known as the Boxer Uprising, was an anti-foreign, 
> anti-imperialist, and anti-Christian uprising in North China between 1899 and 1901, 
> towards the end of the Qing dynasty, 
> by the Society of Righteous and Harmonious Fists, known as the "Boxers" in English 
> due to many of its members having practised Chinese martial arts, 
> which at the time were referred to as "Chinese boxing". 
> It was defeated by the Eight-Nation Alliance of foreign powers.
>
> Following the First Sino-Japanese War, villagers in North China feared the expansion of foreign spheres of influence and resented the extension of privileges to Christian missionaries, who used them to shield their followers. 
> In 1898, North China experienced several natural disasters, 
> including the Yellow River flooding and droughts, 
> which Boxers blamed on foreign and Christian influence. 
> 
> Beginning in 1899, the movement spread across Shandong and the North China Plain, 
> destroying foreign property such as railroads, 
> and attacking or murdering Christian missionaries and Chinese Christians. 
> 
> The events came to a head in June 1900, 
> when Boxer fighters, convinced they were invulnerable to foreign weapons, 
> converged on Beijing with the slogan 
> "Support the Qing government and exterminate the foreigners".
>
> Diplomats, missionaries, soldiers, and some Chinese Christians 
> took refuge in the Legation Quarter, which the Boxers besieged. 
> The Eight-Nation Alliance—comprising American, Austro-Hungarian, British, French, 
> German, Italian, Japanese, and Russian troops—moved into China to lift the siege 
> and on 17 June stormed the Dagu Fort at Tianjin. 
> 
> Empress Dowager Cixi, who had initially been hesitant, supported the Boxers 
> and on 21 June issued an imperial decree that was 
> a de facto declaration of war on the invading powers. 
> Chinese officialdom was split between those supporting the Boxers 
> and those favouring conciliation, led by Prince Qing. 
> The supreme commander of the Chinese forces, the Manchu general Ronglu, 
> later claimed he acted to protect the foreigners. 
> Officials in the southern provinces ignored the imperial order to fight against foreigners.
>
> The Eight-Nation Alliance, 
> after initially being turned back by the Imperial Chinese military and Boxer militia, 
> brought 20,000 armed troops to China. 
> They defeated the Imperial Army in Tianjin and arrived in Beijing on 14 August, 
> relieving the 55-day Siege of the International Legations. 
> Plunder and looting of the capital and the surrounding countryside ensued, 
> along with summary execution of those suspected of being Boxers in retribution. 
> 
> The Boxer Protocol of 7 September 1901 provided for 
> the execution of government officials who had supported the Boxers, 
> for foreign troops to be stationed in Beijing, 
> and for 450 million taels of silver—more than the government's annual tax revenue—
> to be paid as indemnity over the course of the next 39 years to the eight invading nations. 
> The Qing dynasty's handling of the Boxer Rebellion 
> further weakened their control over China, and led to the Late Qing reforms.
