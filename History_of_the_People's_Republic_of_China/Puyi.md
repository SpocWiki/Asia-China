## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> **Puyi** (7 February 1906 – 17 October 1967) was the last emperor of China, 
> reigning as the eleventh monarch of the Qing dynasty from 1908 
> to 1912 when he was forced to abdicate. 
> 
> Later, he sided with Imperial Japan and was made ruler of Manchukuo — 
> Japanese-occupied Manchuria — in hopes of regaining power as China's emperor. 
> 
> When the Guangxu Emperor died without an heir, 
> Empress Dowager Cixi picked the late emperor's nephew, 
> Puyi, aged two, to succeed him as the Xuantong Emperor. 
> 
> Puyi's father, Zaifeng, Prince Chun, served as regent 
> before Puyi was forced to abdicate as a result of the Xinhai Revolution, 
> which ended two millennia of imperial rule and established the Republic of China.
>
> Empress Dowager Longyu signed the Imperial Edict of the 
> Abdication of the Qing Emperor on Puyi's behalf, 
> and in return the royal family was offered the Articles of Favorable Treatment, 
> which allowed him to retain his imperial title and continue to live in the Forbidden City. 
> 
> From 1 to 12 July 1917, 
> Puyi was briefly restored to the Qing throne by the loyalist general Zhang Xun. 
> 
> In 1924, he was expelled from the capital by warlord Feng Yuxiang after a coup, 
> after which he found refuge in Tianjin and began to court both various warlords 
> and the Japanese, who had long desired control of China. 
>
> After the Japanese invaded Manchuria 
> and established the puppet state of Manchukuo in 1932, 
> they installed Puyi as the state's chief executive. 
> 
> In 1934, Puyi was declared emperor of Manchukuo under the era name "Kangde". 
> He largely resided in the Manchukuo Imperial Palace in Changchun, 
> where he was closely watched by the Japanese as a puppet ruler. 
> At the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1945, 
> Puyi fled the capital and was captured by the Soviet Red Army. 
> 
> On 16 August 1946, he testified at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal, 
> and in 1950, was repatriated to the People's Republic of China. 
> Puyi was then imprisoned and re-educated as a war criminal until his release in 1959.
>
> After his release, Puyi published an autobiography (ghostwritten by Li Wenda) 
> under the pressure of the Communist government 
> and became a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. 
> 
> He died in 1967 and was ultimately buried near the Western Qing tombs 
> in a commercial cemetery. Puyi married five times, but had no children.
