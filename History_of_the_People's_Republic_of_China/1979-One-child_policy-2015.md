## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The one-child policy (Chinese: 一孩政策; pinyin: yī hái zhèngcè) 
> was a population planning initiative in China implemented between 1979 and 2015 
> to curb the country's population growth by restricting many families to a single child. 
> 
> The program had wide-ranging social, cultural, economic, and demographic effects, 
> although the contribution of one-child restrictions to the broader program 
> has been the subject of controversy. 
> 
> Its efficacy in reducing birth rates and defensibility from a human rights perspective 
> have been subjects of controversy.
> 
> After [[../../../../../../Society/Politics/Government/Leader/Modern_Leaders/Mao_Zedong|Mao_Zedong]]s incentives for high birth-rates in the 1950s, 
> China's family planning policies began to be shaped by fears of overpopulation in the 1970s, 
> and officials raised the age of marriage and called for fewer and more broadly spaced births. 
> 
> A near-universal one-child limit was imposed in 1980 
> and written into the country's constitution in 1982. 
> 
> Numerous exceptions were established over time, 
> and by 1984, only about 35.4% of the population was subject to the original restriction of the policy. 
> 
> In the mid-1980s, rural parents were allowed to have a second child if the first was a daughter. 
> It also allowed exceptions for some other groups, 
> including ethnic minorities under 10 million people. 
> 
> In 2015, the government raised the limit to two children, and in May 2021 to three. 
> In July 2021, it removed all limits, 
> shortly after implementing financial incentives to encourage individuals to have additional children.
>
> Implementation of the policy was handled at the national level 
> primarily by the National Population and Family Planning Commission 
> and at the provincial and local level by specialized commissions. 
> 
> Officials used pervasive propaganda campaigns 
> to promote the program and encourage compliance. 
> The strictness with which it was enforced varied by period, region, and social status. 
> In some cases, 
> women were forced to use contraception, receive abortions, and undergo sterilization. 
> Families who violated the policy faced large fines and other penalties.
>
> The population control program had wide-ranging social effects, particularly for Chinese women. 
> Patriarchal attitudes and a cultural preference for sons 
> led to the abandonment of unwanted infant girls, some of whom died 
> and others of whom were adopted abroad. 
> 
> Over time, this skewed the country's sex ratio toward men 
> and created a generation of "missing women". 
> 
> However, the policy also resulted in greater workforce participation by women 
> who would otherwise have been occupied with childrearing, 
> and some girls received greater familial investment in their education.
>
> The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) credits the program with 
> contributing to the country's economic ascendancy and says that it prevented 400 million births, 
> although some scholars dispute that estimate. 
> 
> Some have also questioned whether the drop in birth rate 
> was caused more by other factors unrelated to the policy. 
> In the West, the policy has been widely criticized for human rights violations and other negative effects.
