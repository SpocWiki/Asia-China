> The Han Chinese, alternatively the Han people, are an East Asian ethnic group 
> native to Greater China. 
> 
> With a global population of over 1.4 billion, 
> the Han Chinese are the world's largest ethnic group, 
> making up about 17.5% of the world population. 
> 
> The Han Chinese represent 91.11% of the population in China 
> and 97% of the population in Taiwan. 
> Han Chinese are also a significant diasporic group in Southeast Asian countries 
> such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. 
> In Singapore, people of Han Chinese or Chinese descent 
> make up around 75% of the country's population.
>
> The Han Chinese have exerted a primary formative influence in the 
> development and growth of Chinese civilization. 
> 
> Originating from Zhongyuan, the Han Chinese trace their ancestry to the Huaxia people, 
> a confederation of agricultural tribes that lived along the middle and lower reaches 
> of the Yellow River in the north central plains of China. 
> The Huaxia are the progenitors of Chinese civilization 
> and ancestors of the modern Han Chinese.
>
> Han Chinese people and culture later spread southwards in the Chinese mainland, 
> driven by large and sustained waves of migration 
> during successive periods of Chinese history, 
> for example the Qin (221–206 BC) and Han (202 BC – 220 AD) dynasties, 
> leading to a demographic and economic tilt towards the south, 
> and the absorption of various non-Han ethnic groups 
> over the centuries at various points in Chinese history. 
> 
> The Han Chinese became the main inhabitants 
> of the fertile lowland areas and cities of southern China 
> by the time of the Tang and Song dynasties, with minority tribes occupying the highlands.
